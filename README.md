# Music Theory

This site is a work in progress. It hosts music tools.

## TODO List

- [ ] Allow optionally picking a scale for chord identification to be based on
  - [ ] Should show labels based on the scale (as in enharmonic and such)
  - [ ] There could be an option to show all notes in the scale in the neutral tone on the keyboard/fretboard
  - [ ] At some point we may be able to actually factor in the scale into the heuristic of guessing the chord
- [ ] Custom favicon
- [ ] CI testing
- [ ] Make lower strings a bit thicker
- [ ] Add tutorial
- [ ] If you type "rick" into the scale identifier note section it should rickroll you when you click play
- [ ] Fetch audio samples in a better fashion
  - [ ] Only make a certain number of requests at once
  - [ ] Retry failed requests once
  - [ ] Tell the user that the audio failed to load (don't show the audio playback button also)
