# Music Theory

## TODO List
- [ ] Add customizable fretboard with presets
- [ ] Allow showing of `CanonicalPitch` on the keyboard like it is on the fretboard
- [ ] Rename `Piano` to `Keyboard` as it is more appropriate
- [ ] Allow optionally picking a scale for chord identification to be based on
    - [ ] Should show labels based on the scale (as in enharmonic and such)
    - [ ] There could be an option to show all notes in the scale in the neutral tone on the keyboard/fretboard
    - [ ] At some point we may be able to actually factor in the scale into the heuristic of guessing the chord
