# Music Theory

## TODO List

- [ ] Improve the fretboard preset creation process
  - [ ] Show a live fretboard somewhere on the creation screen so they get visual feedback
  - [ ] Make the live fretboard interactive and editable
  - [ ] Make a text field that makes it really easy to fuzzily create a simple fretboard (like notes separated by commas or whatever, the octave number isn't required for notes here it will guess based on other notes if it isn't provided)
  - [ ] Make a first step before the current page where they choose their starting preset. There will be tons and tons of options here with a searchable select sort of thing
- [ ] Allow showing of `CanonicalPitch` on the keyboard like it is on the fretboard
- [ ] Allow optionally picking a scale for chord identification to be based on
  - [ ] Should show labels based on the scale (as in enharmonic and such)
  - [ ] There could be an option to show all notes in the scale in the neutral tone on the keyboard/fretboard
  - [ ] At some point we may be able to actually factor in the scale into the heuristic of guessing the chord
- [ ] Make the whole site responsive (mainly just need to handle smaller screens a bit better)
- [ ] Add links to Github and my main site
- [ ] Custom favicon
- [ ] Update readme to have more than a todo list
  - [ ] Contributing
  - [ ] Info about the project
- [ ] CI testing
